h1. protect_via_honeypots

In the never ending battle with the form bots, here's my attempt to mislead them.
protect_via_honeypots creates some hidden fields. As normal users don't mess with hidden fields we can assume that when those fields are filled with data: a bot filled it.
So when that happens, protect_via_honeypots throws an error (as the same way protect_from_forgery does)

h2. Installation

Install the protect_via_honeypots gem:

<pre>
  sudo gem install protect_via_honeypots
</pre>

Add protect_via_honeypots in environment.rb as a gem dependency:

<pre>
  config.gem "protect_via_honeypots"
</pre>

Or place it in your Gemfile

<pre>
  gem "protect_via_honeypots"
</pre>

h2. Usage

Place the following in your application_controller.rb

<pre>
  protect_via_honeypots
</pre>

And your done!

h1. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
